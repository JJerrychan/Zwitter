# CS 554 Web Programming II Final Project: Zwitter

- In modern society, almost no one can live without using social media. Social media has
been integrated into our daily lives, with 59% of the world's population using social media
for an average of 2 hours and 29 minutes per day (by Global WebIndex).
- Many social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. are monetized by inserting
ads or membership systems, which also affects some of the user experience.
- Our application, Zwitter, was designed to be a social media outlet that is in line with the
perceptions of the young people of Generation Z (the generation born between 1997
and 2012). It will be divided into several sections according to the interests that young
people like. Users can express their opinions and share and like the content they like.
